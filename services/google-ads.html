			<p>
				Google is an integral part of how people find information on the
				web and is often the first stop for potential customers
				looking for your product or service. Unfortunately, very few
				searchers look past the first few results, making it very
				difficult for smaller businesses to compete.
			</p>
			<p>
				Advertising on Google allows you to compete on a more level playing field
				and ensure your message is displayed when someone searches for
				phrases that are related to your business

				settings it can be difficult to know if you're doing the right
				thing. By running Google
				Ads with Bright Dot, you can feel comfortable knowing we are
